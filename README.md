# EventRelay

While it may not strive to be the fastest or most webscale event streaming/storage system available, EventRelay isn't designed to rival powerhouse platforms like Kafka in terms of throughput or latency. Instead, it focuses on providing a low-maintenance, dependable, and user-friendly alternative for the majority of users. Preliminary load testing indicates that a single instance of EventRelay can manage approximately 12,000 requests per second (rps), suggesting its suitability for meeting the requirements of up to 80% of applications.

## Use Cases

### Event Streaming

EventRelay allows your applications to both publish and consume events through a GRPC API. It employs a pull-based approach to event streaming, akin to projects like Kafka.

### Debug Log

Integrate EventRelay seamlessly into your debugging process by sending events to the same locations where you would typically log debug information. This enables you to easily filter and search events, aiding in the resolution of issues within your application.

### Metrics Collection

Effortlessly send events to EventRelay and define your desired metrics.

### Audit Log

Leverage EventRelay to record events every time you need to track user actions on specific resources within your system.

Example:

Bosun is an Elixir-based authorization package that generates an audit log and can optionally transmit it to EventRelay.

### Webhooks

EventRelay includes built-in webhook support, eliminating the need to concern yourself with implementing retry logic or other complexities associated with sending POST requests.

### Websockets

Whether you're implementing a notification system, a chat application, or simply updating metrics on a dashboard, EventRelay effortlessly manages all aspects of websocket communication for you.

## Local Development
To start the server:

- Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
- Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
- Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:9000`](http://localhost:9000) from your browser.


## GRPC

Command to produce Elixir GRPC autogenerated code: `protoc --elixir_out=plugins=grpc:./lib/event_relay_web/grpc
--elixir_opt=include_docs=true --elixir_opt=package_prefix=ERWeb.Grpc  *.proto`

Get a list of topics:

```
grpcurl -plaintext -proto event_relay.proto localhost:50051 eventrelay.EventRelay.ListTopics
```

Response:

```
{
  "topics": [
    {
      "id": "09d5e848-27ca-4fbc-83e5-d1b9356bb764",
      "name": "default"
    }
  ]
}
```

Create a topic:

```
grpcurl -plaintext -proto event_relay.proto -d '{"name": "metrics"}' localhost:50051 eventrelay.EventRelay.CreateTopic
```

Delete a topic:

```
grpcurl -plaintext -proto event_relay.proto -d '{"id": ""}' localhost:50051 eventrelay.EventRelay.DeleteTopic
```

Publish an event:

```
grpcurl -plaintext -proto event_relay.proto -d '{"topic": "users", "events": [{"name": "user.created", "data": "{\"first_name\": \"Thomas\"}", "source": "grpc", "context": {"ip_address": "127.0.0.1"}}]}' localhost:50051 eventrelay.EventRelay.PublishEvents
```

Load test the publish event:

```
ghz --rps 10000 --total 20000 --insecure --proto event_relay.proto --call eventrelay.EventRelay.PublishEvents -d '{"topic": "users", "events": [{"name": "user.created", "data": "{\"first_name\": \"Thomas\"}", "source": "grpc", "context": {"ip_address": "127.0.0.1"}}]}'  localhost:50051
```

Publish an event without a topic to trigger dead letter:

```
grpcurl -plaintext -proto event_relay.proto -d '{"durable": true, "events": [{"name": "user.updated2", "data": "{\"first_name\": \"Bob\"}", "source": "grpc", "group_key": "testgroup", "reference_key": "testref", "trace_key": "testtrace", "context": {"ip_address": "127.0.0.1"}}]}' localhost:50051 eventrelay.EventRelay.PublishEvents
```

Pull Events:

```
grpcurl -plaintext -proto event_relay.proto -d '{"topic": "users", "offset": 0, "batch_size": 10}' localhost:50051 eventrelay.EventRelay.PullEvents
```

Pull Events (w/ filter and cast_as):

```
grpcurl -plaintext -proto event_relay.proto -d '{"topic": "carts", "offset": 0, "batch_size": 10, "filters": [{"field_path": "data.cart.total", "comparison": ">", "value": "10", "cast_as": "INTEGER"}]}' localhost:50051 eventrelay.EventRelay.PullEvents
```

Create a subscription:

```
grpcurl -plaintext -proto event_relay.proto -d '{"subscription": {"name": "events4life", "topic_name": "users", "topic_identifier": "123", "config": {"endpoint_url": "https://example.com/webhooks/users"}, "push": true, "subscription_type": "websocket"}}' localhost:50051 eventrelay.EventRelay.CreateSubscription

Create ApiKey:

eventrelay.EventRelay.CreateApiKey
```

Events are stored in a per topic table. If the event topic name is `users` then the table that stores the events will be
`users_events`. This is done to shard the events over multiple tables instead of having one massive events table.

## Topic

A topic is like a bucket that is used to organize your events. It is composed of 2 parts:

Ex. `users:123`

The first part `users` is the topic name (character limit of 50) and the second part `123` is the topic id - which is optional. The topic id if provided allows you to scope access to the topic. See the Authentication and Authentication section.

More examples of valid topics:

Ex.

- `form_submissions`
- `signups:987`

A topic name can only be a max of 50 characters.

## Authentication and Authorization

There are two types of API keys: producer and consumer.

A producer API key is allowed to interact with the all of the GRPC API and

## Delivery Guarantees

For websocket and streaming GRPC API there is a best effort attempt to deliver the event. What this means is EventRelay will
attempt to deliver the event but if there are network issue or a client is not connected at the time the event occurs the event wil notbe received by the client. There is no acknowledgement mechanism or offset tracking via these 2 channels.

For webhooks any 2xx HTTP response status will be accepted as acknowledgement of receiving the event. Any other HTTP
status will be considered a failure to acknowledge receiving the event and the event will be retried according
to the webhook retry configuration. By default up to 20 attempts will be made before it is marked as undeliverable.
~~Webhooks are also processed in order per topic per destination so if EventRelay gets something other than a 2xx response
it will pause sending events for that topic/destination to preserve the order.~~
